            <h1>Saheli Mobile Application</h1>
            <p>This is a website I created in a team of 4 people for <b> Google Solution Challenge.</b> We chose women empowerment theme for our project and completed it in a time interval of 10 days. We have used flutter and firebase for making this project. It is a safety application for women so that they can contact, share location or send an SOS emergency message to their trusted contacts. Parents and children can login on the application separately and parents can keep a track of their children through the application.</p>

    <h1>Stree</h1>
    <p>Stree is the website I developed in the team of three for Women Empowerment for participating in a hackathon conducted by Innerve IGDTUW. This website allows the women to keep in touch with their family memebers, local admin(NGOs etc) and super admin(Police stations near them) at the time of emergency and help them contact for help in one click. We have provided the option to send a message or do a video or audio call by pushing a button. Women can even share their locations with their emergency contacts. </p>
